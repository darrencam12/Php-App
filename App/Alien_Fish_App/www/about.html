                    <p class="aboutinfo">Spot the Alien Fish is a citizen science
                        campaign through which the sea users and the public in general
                        are encouraged to contribute information on the arrival of
                        new (alien) fish species to Maltese waters and how these fish
                        species are spreading over time in our waters.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutinfo">
                        The campaign is coordinated by Prof. Alan Deidun from the Department
                        of Geosciences at the University of Malta and builds on the success
                        of the Spot the Jellyfish citizen science campaign. The campaign is
                        supported by the IOI, the University of Malta, the Department of
                        Fisheries and ERA.

                        Through the Spot the Alien Fish, everyone can act as a
                        marine biologist by helping scientists in their day-to-day work,
                        especially since more and more marine alien species are reaching our
                        waters. We look forward to your reports â€“ we welcome all records of
                        alien fish species, not just the ones listed in this app developed
                        by MCAST students. Wish you some great fish spotting!
